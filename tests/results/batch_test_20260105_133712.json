Though a lively enough town, priests are in short supply thanks to an imminent war with the Church, hence Col's sudden designation as \"The Twilight Cardinal,\" savior of the people! And as if a city's worth of religious problems isn't enough to deal with, suddenly Myuri is demanding to be Col's bride?! Meanwhile, a wool merchant named Ilenia approaches the \"couple,\" confiding that she's the embodiment of a sheep, before asking for their aid with some secret agenda she has cooked up...Though unsure just what to make of this sheep in merchant's clothing, Col and Myuri can't ignore her once she mentions the Moon-Hunting Bear.\n\n[From [Yen Press](https://yenpress.com/titles/9781975302757-wolf-parchment-new-theory-spice-wolf-vol-3-light-novel)]",

Col and Myuri have come to this bustling metropolis at Heir Hyland’s request—but as soon as they land, they find themselves caught between heavily armed tax collectors and mercenaries hired by the local merchants association. The stakes are high when it becomes clear that Rausbourne’s troubles are simply one part of the wider conflict between the Kingdom and the Church, which has actually worsened due to Col’s deeds as the Twilight Cardinal. If nothing changes, it’ll be only a matter of time before fighting breaks out. Right as things start to look their bleakest, Lawrence’s old archrival Eve Bolan offers a convenient lifeline. Will the fearless miser turn out to be friend or foe? Either way, Col has no choice but to dive into a three-pronged standoff between the Church, the Kingdom, and the merchants!\n\n[From [Yen Press](https://yenpress.com/titles/9781975399337-wolf-parchment-new-theory-spice-wolf-vol-4-light-novel)]",

Two young women—warrior priestess Nayuta, and ninja Koyomi, who met and became friends in-game—come across a mysterious priest named Yanagi. The elderly man tells them that he’s looking for a detective to solve a riddle, and that the reward for this quest will be one million yen. Shocked by the outlandish sum of this peculiar request, the two girls come across an equally peculiar young man, who claims to be able to do the job as well as any other detective. With all his stat points invested in Luck, the man is useless in battle, but he does still seem to have some tricks up his sleeve, like that unbeatable drop rate for rare items...
